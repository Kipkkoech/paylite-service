   üîç Correlation ID & Logging
   MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) Implementation
   The service uses SLF4J MDC for structured logging with correlation IDs across the entire request lifecycle:
   Automated Correlation ID Handling:
   ‚Ä¢	Request Interceptor: Automatically extracts/generates correlation IDs
   ‚Ä¢	MDC Context: Populates correlationId, paymentId, apiKey, userAgent in logging context
   ‚Ä¢	Async Support: MDC context propagated to @Async methods
   ‚Ä¢	Cleanup: Automatic MDC clearing after request completion
   Log Format Example:
   json
   {
   "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
   "level": "INFO",
   "logger": "com.paylite.service.PaymentService",
   "message": "Payment created successfully",
   "correlationId": "corr_123456789",
   "paymentId": "pl_a1b2c3d4",
   "apiKey": "key_abc123",
   "endpoint": "/api/v1/payments",
   "duration_ms": 45
   }
   Supported MDC Fields
   ‚Ä¢	correlationId: Unique identifier for request tracing
   ‚Ä¢	paymentId: Payment identifier for payment-related operations
   ‚Ä¢	apiKey: API key identifier for audit tracking
   ‚Ä¢	userAgent: Client identification
   ‚Ä¢	endpoint: API endpoint being called
   ‚Ä¢	httpMethod: HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)

      Structured Logging with MDC
      All logs include correlation context for easy tracing:
      Key Log Events:
      java
      // Payment creation
      log.info("Payment created successfully",
      Map.of("paymentId", paymentId, "amount", amount, "status", "PENDING"));

// Webhook processing  
log.info("Webhook event processed",
Map.of("paymentId", paymentId, "eventType", eventType, "status", "PROCESSED"));

// Idempotency hits
log.debug("Idempotency key hit",
Map.of("key", idempotencyKey, "paymentId", existingPaymentId));

// Security events
log.warn("Invalid API key attempted",
Map.of("apiKey", maskedApiKey, "sourceIp", sourceIp));
Log Search Examples:
bash
# Find all logs for a specific payment
grep '"paymentId":"pl_a1b2c3d4"' application.log

# Trace entire request flow by correlation ID
grep '"correlationId":"corr_123456789"' application.log

# Monitor security events
